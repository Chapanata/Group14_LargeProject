### Getting Started
To get started you first need,
- npm [(download)](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- node.js (downloaded with npm) 

First open up your operating system's console and change directories to the repository under the folder ExpressServer. An example of this in Windows,<br>

Next run, `npm install` to install necessary dependencies.

Finally run, `node index.js` to execute the index.js file. This will start a node.js server and open up a connection at `http://localhost:3000`. You can then run the app by opening that url in your browser. An example of this in Windows and Chrome,<br>
